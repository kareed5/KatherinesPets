		<p style="margin-top: 55px;">This is my cat, Ramsey. He's a black American Shorthair and will be turning 11 in March. He is very shy and doesn't like strangers, but loves cuddling with his family. We got him from the animal shelter after he was rescued as a kitten from the side of a highway after his mom was hit and killed. He is extremely smart and agile, and loves exploring inside the house and outdoors (even though he's not supposed to leave the house). I jokingly call him my son because he and I have always had a special bond.</p>
