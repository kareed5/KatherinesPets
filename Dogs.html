	<p style="margin-top: 55px;">This is one of my dogs, Lydia. She is a 10-year-old Golden Retriever and has been part of my family since she was a puppy. She is very sweet and loves to cuddle. She was extremely crazy and energetic as a puppy, but has since calmed down and turned into a relatively well-behaved dog. She loves playing fetch, chasing squirrels, and jumping on furniture (even though she's not allowed). She was the first pet my family had since I was a baby so she'll always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

	<p style="margin-top: 55px;">This is my other dog, Ruby. She is a Chocolate Lab and will be turning 3 later this month. She is incredibly sweet, and is a bindle of energy. She loves running around and exploring and eating things she's not supposed to. We got her right before COVID-19 hit, so getting her into puppy training was a struggle. Still, she is a great dog and is slowly beginning to calm down as she grows out of her puppy energy. I love her very dearly, and she is definitely the most fun to play with out of all of my pets.</p>
